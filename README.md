# ImpexDocs-CodingChallenge

## Background Information

ImpexDocs is a leading provider of import and export documentation. The product is designed to help streamline the overall process with shipping, sales, invoicing etc.

You have been given the task to showcase build out an initial prototype of the next generation SaaS solution for ImpexDocs. You will need to be able to demonstrate your abilities as a full stack developer working on the code base as if it will be going out into production.

We anticipate the task to take you approximately 8-10 hours to complete but may possibly take you more based on how far you wish to go.

### What we are looking for

1. Attention to detail. You will need to carefully read through the requirements and constraints and make sure to comply with that
2. Quality of code. This is your chance to shine as a Software Engineer. You need to demonstrate your bredth of knowledge. Things we look for include 
  - Code structure (think through how many projects in the solution, what is the strcture, what architecture you will use etc)
  - Automated tests (unit, integration etc)
  - Scalability of solution
  - Security aspects
  - Extensibility of code
  - SOLID principles in action
3. Breadth of knowledge in the field. We want you to showcase how much you understand in the area of software development. Yoi want to really use this to showcase the various talents you have

### Constraints

THe main constraints we have on this solution is that it shall be a `.NET Core` backend. You will need to provide a readme documentation to your file on how to execute and have it run by our Engineers. If your code does not build or we can not get it to run based on your instructions, we will not be going any further.
